            <b>This is section 1 in the document.</b> 
            It contains some sample text. It's just a lot of sample text to be honest.
            Maybe a joke... What do you call a donkey with 3 legs? A wonkey.

        <p>
            <a name="section2"></a>
            <b>This is section 2 in the document.</b> 
            It contains some more sample text. It's just more text.
            Maybe another joke... A shepherd tells his sheepdog to gather in the sheep. An hour later, the sheepdog reports back.
            The shepherd says to the sheepdog, "Good dog. How many sheep did you gather?" The sheepdog replies, "40".
            The shepherd looks confused: "But I've only got 37 sheep", he says. 
            And the dog replies, "I rounded them up".

            <a name="section3"></a>
            <b>This is section 3 in the document.</b> 
            Let's cut straight to the joke...
            What do you call a man with a plank of wood on his head? Edward.
            What do you call a man with 2 planks of wood on his head? Ed Woodward.
            What do you call a man with 3 planks of wood on his head? Edward Woodward.
            What do you call a man with 4 planks of wood on his head? You don't know, do you? Neither do I, but Edward Woodward would.
